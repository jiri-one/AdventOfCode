Estimate the maximum amount of geode by assuming that we can build a geode robot at each time step. If that estimation is less or equal than the currently known maximal amount of geode, we do not have further investigate that branch.

If we choose to wait (and not build a robot, but could have built it), do not build that robot in the next turn either.

Do not build more robots than needed to build another robot, e.g. if the most expensive robot costs 5 ore, do not build more than 5 ore robots.

Always build a geode robot if you can and do not investigate other branches in that case.
