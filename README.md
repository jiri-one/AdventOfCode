# Advent of Code solutions

This is my repository with solutions of puzzles from amazing site [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com]).

## Notes
- my solutions are structured in directories with name AOC20?? where ?? is always the current year.
- most of code has been written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) (the more difficult one with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/))
- but some puzzles have been written in [Dart language](https://dart.dev/)
- because I have used more languages, some additional files are in repository, because I need some helper for all languages, which I have been using.
